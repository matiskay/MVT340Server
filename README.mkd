# MVT340Server v 0.1.1

A Meitrack MVT340 TCP server for OpenGTS
Original at https://github.com/camiloforero/MVT340Server

## Changelog:
* 15/03/2015 - v. 0.1: Created the mvt340 server based on the OpenGTS template, it works.
* 16/03/2015 - v. 0.1.1: Added the readme, notice, `build_mod` and `dcservers_mod` files for easier implementation

As the description says, this is a custom dcserver that allows OpenGTS to communicate with a Meitrack MVT340 device
This code is based off the "template" server included.

This code works for v. 2.5.8 of OpenGTS

## Functionality:
1 Detect and log gps events for
  * SOS button
  * Timed events
  * GPS signal lost
  * GPS signal recovered
    
## Installation steps:

1. Modify the dcservers.xml in OpenGTS' root directory to include the snippet in `dcservers_mod.xml`. Remember to replace the TCP and UDP ports by those you want to use, by default I put port 27868 for both of them.
2. Modify the source in `org/opengts/db/DCServerFactory` to include the constant `public static final String  MVT_340_NAME                       = "mvt340";           // [27838]`
3. Put the mvt340 package source inside the `org/opengts/servers` directory of the OpenGTS source
4. Use `ant all` to rebuild the project
5. Use `ant mvt340` to build the new server
6. It's done. You can start the new server using the command `$GTS_HOME/bin/runserver.pl -s mvt340`
